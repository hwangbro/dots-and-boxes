# dots-and-boxes
Code for basic logical and graphical implementation of "Dots and Boxes"

Project worked on in my own time, built up from scratch. Implementation uses tkinter for the graphical interface.
More information about the game can be found here: 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes

To run the application, have all the files in the same directory and run "dots_application_gui.py".
All files written in Python 3.
